After "up"ing the desired node, it will automagically start looking
for peers via the discovery protocol (looking for peers on TCP/UDP 30303).

you can use the interactive GETH console by executing following command:

 docker exec -it [CONTAINER_NAME] geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8545


where [CONTAINER_NAME] can be one of these values or the corresponding container-id:

eth_node_goerli-superfast_gethnode_1
eth_node_goerli-fast_gethnode_1
eth_node_goerli-full_gethnode_1
eth_node_goerli-light_gethnode_1

INSIDE the node-container you can run following commands:

> net.listening 
-> Prints TRUE if the server is listening for incoming connections.
> net.peerCount
-> Prints the number of peers that are connected to the node
