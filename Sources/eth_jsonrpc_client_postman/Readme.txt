The original source for our POSTMAN export is:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4117254/ethereum-json-rpc/RVu7CT5J

Steps to use this client:

1. Import into POSTMAN
2. Go into ENVIRONMENTS section
3. Create new ENVIRONMENT for development, call it "dev.cryptng"
4. Create a new environment variable called "ENVIRONMENT" without quotation marks
5. The value should be: "http://YOURRPCSERVER:YOURPORT" without quotation marks
6. SAVE
7. AT THE TOP RIGHT LEFT OF THE "EYE" ICON, SWITCH TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT

#FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER #1 THE VALUE FOR "ENVIRONMENT" SHOULD BE#
http://hub.cryptng.app:8545


IMPORTANT:
Do not press ENTER when you set the environment variable.
This would add the "ENTER" character into the variable.
Instead, click somewhere.
