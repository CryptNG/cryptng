NOTE:
Ideally, set up our dotnet alias as described in the main readme (alias section).
Open the folder that this readme is inside of with visual studio code like so:

use wsl, navigate here, type "code ."
then open vscode terminal and type
source ~/.profile (to reload the profile, vscode does not automatically do this)
this has to be done every time until we find a way to fix realoding.

dotnet new console  ---> creates a console program
dotnet run --> runs your program
