VERY IMPORTANT:
DO NOT ENABLE OPTIMIZER IN TRUFFLE-CONFIG!!!
IF YOU ENABLE THE OPTIMIZER, TRUFFLE DEBUGGER WILL BE VERY CONFUSED ALL THE TIME.
MEANING IT WILL OUTPUT NONSENSE AND STEP ALONG INCORRECT PLACES IN THE CODE

chronologically:

note: if you use our truffle image to initialize the project
files will be generated by the container root and you do not have permission
to change them.

run this until we fix the image:
sudo chown -R user:user ~/path

set local ganache network in 
truffle-config 

IMPORTANT
WHEN CREATING THE CONTRACT, MIND THAT THE OPENZEPPELIN NAMESPACE CHANGED!
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
INSTEAD OF 
import "@openzeppelin/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

IMPORTANT:
Start VS-Code (or any other IDE) in the "test_contract" project directory

IMPORTANT:
the command to open the truffle console to our development configuration is
truffle console
NOT truffle development <- this creates a new local chain
to test if truffle console works:
var token = await MinimalERC721.deployed();
output: undefined
then type:
token.name();
