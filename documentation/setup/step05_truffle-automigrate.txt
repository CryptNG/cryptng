in your truffle smart-contract project, you have to change the contracts
deploy migration functionality under 'migrations'
as explained in our 1_cryptngTesttoken.js

explanation inside file:
   //whenever we migrate the contract, we had to manually copy-paste the newly build ABI json
   //from build/contracts/ctyptngTesttoken to the ember application ABI variable.
   //this code reads the ember application file and replaces the abi variable with the current abi
   //whenever a migration deploys a new contract.
   //this matches the logic we implemented in the emberjs application to detect a newly migrated contract
   
   //create symlink from $HOME/test_app like so:
   //from the path of your ember application root to your home/emberapplication root
   //ln -s sources/cryptng/documentation/workshops/workshop_1_030222/test_app/ ${HOME}/test_app
   //we link test_app from our home to the full path, then use the container root (which looks at our home path
   //which was set up in the aliases section of our documentation)
   //to go to test_app, which will lead to the symlink
   //this works because truffle-container root is mapped to $HOME of the host
   
   //NOTE, do not remove the try catch.
   //if you do, any fail will result in a broken contract deployment.
   
   
//THE REASON:
//we just don't want to manually copy-paste the abi json into our ember application every time
//that we migrate a new contract.
//this setup works in tandem with our migrate code in the test app, which retrieves the latest contract address
//from the chain, since we are the only people working on it, any contract that has been deployed in the newest
//blocks is inevitably our current smart contract address
