INBOX is a cryptographic p2p messaging app
idea: trade nfts like INBOX chat
it's cryptographically encrypted with the private key of the wallet

do not use ipfs - confidentiality not provided

NFTs X executions, Xtime eg. 100 executions, 100 mins
---> over 1 min time, 1min will be burned, nft stays

NFTs X time, X NFTs ---> cg says too much packs instead, makes sense

NFT encrypted attribute

generate access token / execution token via smart contract interaction -> NFT smart contract
"createAccessToken" checks if the user has enough capacity with his NFTs
(whats the max runtime of the user, does he have a fitting nft) 
cannot create new access token as long as he has an open access token
every service/customer needs own wallet
you can use/burn the accessToken (aT) or withdraw it.
block withsrawal of aT while service running.
reserve "colleteral" tax for blocking []
roadmap distribute tokens based on earnings at the end of Xtime

-> testNFTtype 
-> set up rpi3 with our pdf distiller, provide christian with root ssh

blockaccesstoken for nft runtime

which blockchain/layer
ETH.L1.distiller [config defines NFT price]
ETH.L2.distiller [config defines NFT price]
ETH.TestNet 	 [config defines NFT price]

testNFT -> ourService
prodNFT -> cloud
