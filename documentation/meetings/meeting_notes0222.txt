THIS IS OUR LAST DAY FOR THIS WORKSHOP

Work Todo:


* Create webpage to use this service conveniently/manually (EMBER PROJECT)
* Webpage has: connect -> check wallet -> mint + toolbar for transfer, burn, (for us, maybe ->) allow/disallow services
* CLI-Tool from current test_client (CS-PROJECT)
* CLI-Tool needs to be able to load wallet maybe generate
* Service (Server) should have own wallet. (appsettings)
* Smart Contract allowance so another contract can create executiontickets for somebody else
* Smart Contract getNextActiveExecutionTicket



Currently:
if you forget your executionTicket secret, you'll have to burn your minibatch.
