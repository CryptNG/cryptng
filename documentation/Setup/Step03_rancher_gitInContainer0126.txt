Following tutorial creates an alias "git"
which will start a docker-container with GIT in it and pass your repository/commands as arguments to the container.


following this tutorial:
https://github.com/alpine-docker/git


nano ~/.profile

add following lines:
#######################COPY AFTER THIS
function git () {
    (docker run -ti --rm -v ${HOME}:/root -v $(pwd):/git alpine/git "$@")
}
#######################COPY BEFORE THIS

save, exit and type

source ~/.profile

now the "git" alias command will be persisted between reboots.


for example, if you need clone this repository, with the function you just set, you can run it as local command

git clone https://github.com/alpine-docker/git.git












########### the following text is an old version of this tutorial
########### it will not persist between reboots and is here just to keep ########### our process documented


alias git="docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/git bwits/docker-git-alpine"

now use like this:

git --help
git clone https://github.com/BWITS/docker-git-alpine.git
ls docker-git-alpine

with following comment:

For those coming from Google, RancherOS does not have a /home/rancher/.profile file for you to add aliases, so you will need to create it first.

sudo vi /home/rancheros/.profile then paste and :wq.
