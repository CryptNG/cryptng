prepare bootable rancherOS stick with RUFUS or UNETBOOTIN
If the server is a baremetal machine, and rather old, you'll need to
check following configurations:
- legacy boot should be enabled in BIOS
- usb booting should be enabled in BIOS
- use an USB 2.0 Stick or older

boot from stick, normally frantically pressing F12 will get you to the
boot menu, alternatively, change the boot order in bios.
don't forget that changing bios boot order will affect boot behavior
until you change it back, don't leave the stick in.

wait for rancher to be ready, it'll show two cows

sudo passwd rancher [NEWPASSWORD]

this user is temporary

find rancherOS machine IP-Address by looking for the "rancher" host,
this can be in your router.
alternatively, check for the ip on the machine.

go to another machine in your network.
SSH from putty to the machine, use the password and user you just set
(RANCHER, PASSWORD)

from this point on, i will be assuming you are using another machine
+ putty.
no direct access to rancherOS needed for now.

we need a minimal cloud-config to set up the installation
we will use vim since nano is not preinstalled
before we do that though, you'll need to create a pub/priv keypair.
you may use puttygen for that.
save the private key, remember the password.
copy the public key.

type: vi cloud-config.yml
press: i
paste this:

--------->FROM HERE
#cloud-config
ssh_authorized_keys:
  - ssh-rsa AANON3NzaC1yc2THISISANEXAMPLEQSzfY80/KfhHPAg9tS8RivnaRZANDMETHODICALLYKNOCKINGPEOPLE'SHATSOFFâ€”THEN,IACCOUNTITHIGHTIMETOGETTOSEAASSOONASICANXlgDlebLadTdM+0N5Pyqe2ClhY/J30/J9ADONTEVENTRYllOfT/tjvPaqL3q2IWsNeU9CNOTAREALKEYZqKw2i4Z9WzaDq2F8AFz+Nga4B9tCMgKMQg7JpIjC6AIcoNTnI601Oly1VUTHECAKEISALIEtHHpMTmpyH35fF/1vwz6fvEAwXhyzBL33TH4CKERZ7w+OU181 rsa-key-20220122
---------> TO HERE (EXCLUDING OF COURSE THESE COMMENTS)

BE CAREFUL, YOU WANT TO PASTE THE PUBLIC KEY IN YOUR CLIPBOARD INTO THE
"SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS" SECTION, NOT USE THIS ONE.

save with :x  
  
then:
sudo ros install -c cloud-config.yml -d /dev/sda

this will run the installation

it will reboot

now to make future access easier with putty:

type in the rancherOS machine IP into putty.
be sure that this IP does not change, if possible, change your
router settings to always assign the same IP to the rancher machine.

in SSH -> AUTH-Settings, add your private key

save this putty session with a name, so everytime you load it will
also load your SSH -> AUTH SETTINGS and IP ADDRESS.

log in via putty-ssh 
enter private key password


if you want to login via password in the future
(this is not recommended by rancher)
use: sudo passwd rancher PASSSWORD

now you can log in
next, change the console to debian console to be able to use apt-get and nano instead of vim, if you hate me now, idc.
if you prefer vim, you probably have enough know-how to ignore this whole tutorial anyway.


sudo ros console list
sudo ros console switch debian

proceed


run 
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install nano

configure
port forwarding from ext 2222 to 22

now people can access this rancher instance via SSH to 2222 and your external IP
